## Slide 1: Title Slide

# Hands-On Coding: Building Basic Application Tools
## From Theory to Practice - Understanding the Fundamentals

**Presented by:** Ankur Mursalin  
**Lead Software Engineer, Nerddevs**

*"The best way to understand a tool is to build it yourself."*

**5-Minute Journey Through Low-Level Programming**

---

## Slide 2: The Journey Begins

# üéØ [My Coding Challenge Adventure](https://github.com/Encryptioner/blogs/tree/master/topics/Coding%20Challenges)

**Two challenges that changed everything:**

1. **[Challenge: Which](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-which)**
   - Simple: `echo $PATH` and extract executable paths
   - My first coding challenge ever!

2. **[Challenge: Shell](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-shell)**
   - Complex: Build a functional Unix shell
   - Low-level system programming

*"I wanted to do both together - and it was the best decision I made."*

---

## Slide 3: Why Build Basic Tools?

# ü§î Why Build What Already Exists?

**The Learning Paradox:**
- We use tools daily without understanding them
- `ls`, `cd`, `which` - simple commands, complex internals
- **Understanding = Better Usage**

**Real Benefits:**
- Debug system issues effectively
- Write better automation scripts
- Appreciate the elegance of Unix philosophy
- **AI can help, but fundamentals matter**

*"AI generated most of my code, but I learned the fundamentals."*

**Question:** How many of you have wondered what happens when you type `ls`?

---

## Slide 4: The "Which" Challenge - Simple but Powerful

# üîç Challenge 1: Building "Which"

**The Problem:**
```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```

**The Challenge:** Recreate this functionality

**My Approach:**
```c
// Parse PATH environment variable
// Check each directory for executable
// Return first match found
```

**Key Learning:** Environment variables, file permissions, PATH parsing

---

## Slide 5: What is a Shell?

# üêö What is a Shell, Really?

**A shell is your interface to the operating system:**
- **Command Interpreter**: Reads your commands and executes them
- **Process Manager**: Creates, manages, and monitors programs
- **Environment Controller**: Manages variables, paths, and settings

**When you type `ls -la`:**
1. Shell reads your input
2. Parses command into `ls` and `-la`
3. Searches PATH for `ls` executable
4. Creates new process with `fork()`
5. Replaces process with `ls` using `exec()`
6. Waits for completion with `wait()`

*"A shell is just a program that runs other programs."*

---

## Slide 6: The Shell Challenge - Going Deep

# üêö Challenge 2: Building a Shell

**The Problem:** Understand what happens when you type `ls -la`

**The Solution:** Build **ccsh** (Compact C Shell)

**Core Features:**
- Command execution with `fork()` and `exec()`
- I/O redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`)
- Background job management
- Built-in commands (`cd`, `pwd`, `exit`)
- Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`)

---

## Slide 7: The "Aha!" Moments

# üí° What I Discovered

**Process Management:**
- `fork()` creates exact process copies
- `exec()` replaces process memory
- File descriptors are just numbers

**System Calls in Action:**
```c
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    execvp(command, args);  // Child becomes new program
} else {
    waitpid(pid, &status, 0);  // Parent waits
}
```

**The Magic:** Understanding how `Ctrl+C` actually works!

---

## Slide 8: Building with Makefiles

# üî® How Makefiles Work

**What is a Makefile?**
- A recipe for building software
- Automates compilation process
- Handles dependencies automatically

**Simple Makefile Example:**
```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -g
LDFLAGS = -lreadline

ccsh: ccsh.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o ccsh ccsh.c $(LDFLAGS)

clean:
	rm -f ccsh
```

**How it works:**
- `make` reads the Makefile
- Checks if `ccsh` is newer than `ccsh.c`
- Runs the compilation command if needed
- `make clean` removes built files

---

## Slide 9: AI as a Learning Partner

# ü§ñ AI + Fundamentals = Powerful Learning

**How AI Helped Me:**
- Generated boilerplate code structure
- Explained complex system calls
- Debugged memory management issues
- Suggested best practices

**What I Learned:**
- AI is a tool, not a replacement
- Understanding fundamentals is crucial
- AI can accelerate learning when you know the basics

*"AI generated the code, but I understood every line."*
