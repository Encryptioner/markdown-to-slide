# Task 1: Initial Setup - Instructions

## General Rules
1. Assess summary of your earlier tasks in `ai-summaries/task-1-initial-setup.md` file. And write or update the summary of your updates in that file when all the current commanded tasks/instructions are done. Keep it short. Include summary of key files changed (with info on functionality changed). You may update it in chronological way by step 1, step 2 and so on. It should reflect the continuos changes done on the codebase.


## Instruction List 1

2. Update Claude.md and README.md file to ensure they are updated. Remove mention of other package manager than `pnpm`. Add tech stack information in README
3. The text in markdown and slide viewer is not clear. Ensure, it works ok regardless of browser theme


### Comments
1. It fixed some issue. But there is more issue


## Instruction List 3

### Instructions
1. There is error related to `document.exitFullscreen?.();`
2. I think, the coloring has issues. The texts are not visible. The markdown background is dark. The slide background is white. The prev/next button doesn't show. When in full screen, the text shows in white background while the screen is black. Fix all coloring issue. The website doesn't need to support multiple theme. It should support light theme only. And it should work good.
3. The PDF popup doesn't look good on mobile screen. Ensure the website works good in all screen
4. The PDF export doesn't work correctly. It exports a blank page only
5. Check the project overview and ensure it fulfill all the required features, goals, standards

### Comments
1. I don't see any reasonable improvement


## Instruction List 4

### Instructions
1. I don't see any color related update. Check earlier instructions and ensure everything is done
2. There is error in console. Fix those

3. Ensure the code is production ready. It can be deployed as github pages and can be used as PWA


### Comments
1. The colors are updated and looks mostly ok now
2. The preview is good. However, the codes need to be shown with special care. It should look good in preview and full screen
3. The load example have issues. It doesn't load example. On load example, the slide number should be reset to 1
4. There should have undo/redo functionality in editor. And common keyboard shortcut for editors should work
5. On saved presentations, the name could be renamed
6. On mobile/small screen, hamburger menu seems not working
7. The `PDF` button still don't show the pdf with the content same as preview. It just shows blank pages. The pdf should be exported in a way that, it can later be used in other pdf/slide viewer to easily show as presentation


## Instruction List 5

### Instructions
1. Continue your earlier tasks
2. Check earlier comments and fix all issues

### Comments
1. It requires clearing cache/site data to see updated ui when running `pnpm dev`. Won't site refresh/hard reload fix that? How to see the updated view every time
2. On running `pnpm dev`, getting this error `Cannot access 'refreshDocuments' before initialization`


## Instruction List 6

### Instructions
1. The pdf export still doesn't work. It just downloads 1 blank page. There is no content where the slide was 2 page long. Fix this. Ensure, one can download an presentable version of pdf
2. Each line of the code (if in markdown) in preview don't need to be centered aligned. However, Code div or content could be centered. And inside that div/area code need to be left aligned for better visibility.
3. The print confirmation and other notification should look good in both mobile and desktop view.

### Comments
1. Reached limit middle of this. Instructed `continue` after limit reset


## Instruction List 7

### Instructions
1. The pdf export still exporting empty page. Let's work on it step by step. First, we should try to export the pdf by using slide viewer, not while full screen. When pdf is clicked, go thorough each page of slide in slide viewer and make page for each of them. Then join them to make one single pdf which can be exported.
2. Later, on the full screen view, we will give a pdf button and it will create pdf from the view of full screen
3. Ensure the website works in both mobile and desktop screen. The UI should be responsive, and there should not have any odd design. 
4. One issue I found that, when switched from desktop to mobile view, there is too much whitespace at bottom of footer
5. Another issue, when browser inspect tab is opened, and I reload the website, it shows `You are offline Please check your internet connection . Is it ok?` I am running `pnpm dev`. My cached is disabled when the network/console shows in browser

### Comments
1. The pdf export issue is still not solved. May need other approach to solve this
2. Other issue needs to be checked
