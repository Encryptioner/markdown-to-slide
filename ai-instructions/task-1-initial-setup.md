# Task 1: Initial Setup - Instructions

## General Rules
1. Assess summary of your earlier tasks in `ai-summaries/task-1-initial-setup.md` file if you haven't already. And write or update the summary of your updates in that file when all the current commanded tasks/instructions are done. Keep it short, concise, to-the-point. Include summary of key files changed (with info on functionality changed). You may update it in chronological way by step 1, step 2 and so on. It should reflect the continuos changes done on the codebase.
2. If the instruction lists are not chronological, fix them


## Instruction List 1

## Instruction List 2

### Instructions
1. Implement the `Project Overview/Phase 1.md` file
2. You can do it some small steps for better handing of the project. But don't forget the goals

2. Update Claude.md and README.md file to ensure they are updated. Remove mention of other package manager than `pnpm`. Add tech stack information in README
3. The text in markdown and slide viewer is not clear. Ensure, it works ok regardless of browser theme


### Comments
1. It fixed some issue. But there is more issue


## Instruction List 4

### Instructions
1. There is error related to `document.exitFullscreen?.();`
2. I think, the coloring has issues. The texts are not visible. The markdown background is dark. The slide background is white. The prev/next button doesn't show. When in full screen, the text shows in white background while the screen is black. Fix all coloring issue. The website doesn't need to support multiple theme. It should support light theme only. And it should work good.
3. The PDF popup doesn't look good on mobile screen. Ensure the website works good in all screen
4. The PDF export doesn't work correctly. It exports a blank page only
5. Check the project overview and ensure it fulfill all the required features, goals, standards

### Comments
1. I don't see any reasonable improvement


## Instruction List 5

### Instructions
1. I don't see any color related update. Check earlier instructions and ensure everything is done
2. There is error in console. Fix those

3. Ensure the code is production ready. It can be deployed as github pages and can be used as PWA


### Comments
1. The colors are updated and looks mostly ok now
2. The preview is good. However, the codes need to be shown with special care. It should look good in preview and full screen
3. The load example have issues. It doesn't load example. On load example, the slide number should be reset to 1
4. There should have undo/redo functionality in editor. And common keyboard shortcut for editors should work
5. On saved presentations, the name could be renamed
6. On mobile/small screen, hamburger menu seems not working
7. The `PDF` button still don't show the pdf with the content same as preview. It just shows blank pages. The pdf should be exported in a way that, it can later be used in other pdf/slide viewer to easily show as presentation


## Instruction List 6

### Instructions
1. Continue your earlier tasks
2. Check earlier comments and fix all issues

### Comments
1. It requires clearing cache/site data to see updated ui when running `pnpm dev`. Won't site refresh/hard reload fix that? How to see the updated view every time
2. On running `pnpm dev`, getting this error `Cannot access 'refreshDocuments' before initialization`


## Instruction List 7

### Instructions
1. The pdf export still doesn't work. It just downloads 1 blank page. There is no content where the slide was 2 page long. Fix this. Ensure, one can download an presentable version of pdf
2. Each line of the code (if in markdown) in preview don't need to be centered aligned. However, Code div or content could be centered. And inside that div/area code need to be left aligned for better visibility.
3. The print confirmation and other notification should look good in both mobile and desktop view.

### Comments
1. Reached limit middle of this. Instructed `continue` after limit reset


## Instruction List 8

### Instructions
1. The pdf export still exporting empty page. Let's work on it step by step. First, we should try to export the pdf by using slide viewer, not while full screen. When pdf is clicked, go thorough each page of slide in slide viewer and make page for each of them. Then join them to make one single pdf which can be exported.
2. Later, on the full screen view, we will give a pdf button and it will create pdf from the view of full screen
3. Ensure the website works in both mobile and desktop screen. The UI should be responsive, and there should not have any odd design. 
4. One issue I found that, when switched from desktop to mobile view, there is too much whitespace at bottom of footer
5. Another issue, when browser inspect tab is opened, and I reload the website, it shows `You are offline Please check your internet connection . Is it ok?` I am running `pnpm dev`. My cached is disabled when the network/console shows in browser

### Comments
1. The pdf export issue is still not solved. May need other approach to solve this
2. Other issue needs to be checked


## Instruction List 9

### Instructions
1. The UI issue is not solved. Refine the design and ensure it works for all screen. I've added some screenshots. Check images which name starts with `after_instruction_list_7` in `screenshots/tasks` directory
2. The examples doesn't load correctly. Specifically the example markdown files. That should be fixed
3. Add some marketing info, add instructions sections, add Q&A, FAQ sections. However, those should be expandable and closable. So, it doesn't take much space unnecessarily. Ensure a cleaner modern look. Revamp the design if necessary.
4. The pdf export still doesn't work. It shows generating PDF. However the generated PDF is an empty page. I have given screenshot in `after_instruction_list_7_3.png` file. Ensure this issue is fixed
5. Ensure the website is modern, minimal, production ready with maintainable codebase 

### Comments
1. It broke some design but added some things


## Instruction List 10

### Instructions
1. Remove the `FAQ` Section
2. In desktop view, the design for markdown editor seems broke. It doesn't take same height as the presentation slide. The markdown editor should take same left space similar to slide preview
3. Recheck design. If necessary rethought the design. Ensure it is minimal but attractive and must work on all screen size.
4. For pdf export, check online if necessary. Find the best option. If getting pdf from html is having problem, let's use some package to create html to image. Then use that image to create PDF.
5. The PDF button in full screen mode should be more understandable. U may use PDF icon/text there.
6. Ensure the pdf export works for both slide preview and full screen preview. Try ur best. Think, research, then implement. Be concise.

### Comments
1. Kind of working version
2. I've updated some part though


## Instruction List 11

### Instructions
1. In desktop, there is border for slide part. But not in markdown part. So, it looks odd. Keep border for both of them
2. Sometimes this error shows in console. It generates from <body className="antialiased"> data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.1251.0"
  A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:
3. In top of the page, add some logo and some minimal text. So, user can understand the concept. Also add a small text/button which will send to `How to use` section
4. Also add blog icon in footer
5.  `Files & Save` button seems having issue in mid size screen. Ensure it works ok for all size

### Comments
1. The implementation is mostly ok
2. I've installed and added phosphorus icon


## Instruction List 12

### Instructions
1. In `html -> image -> PDF` technique, the links of the slide couldn't be accessed. Also, the text couldn't be copied. Are there any other way, which will work? Which will generate pdf and also allow copying text, clicking image
2. If the slide is long, we need it to scale down to fit in the pdf page. So, no text gets cut/removed

### Comments
1. Got Error while export


## Instruction List 13

### Instructions
1. When generating PDF, got this error. Please fix errors and ensure the export works smoothly.
   Failed to export PDF: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'vfs'). Please try again.
   In console: hook.js:608 PDF export failed: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'vfs') at exportToPDF (index.tsx:275:56)

### Comments
1. This error is fixed. But there is new error


## Instruction List 14

### Instructions

   fontProvider.js:52 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Font 'Helvetica' in style 'bold' is not defined in the font section of the document definition.
    at FontProvider.provideFont (fontProvider.js:52:1)

### Comments
1. The issue is still present


## Instruction List 15

### Instructions
1. The issue didn't go away. It must be fixed for production ready development

### Comments
1. The error is gone. However, the content is not up to the mark.
2. The lists, codeblock is left aligned where others are center aligned
3. The links are also not clickable. So that, on click the link will open in new tab of browser


## Instruction List 16

### Instructions
1. Check the comments of earlier instruction list. Fix those issue
2. Ensure the pdf looks similar to slide preview. Check ui styling for the slide preview and apply those for PDF.

### Comments
1. Links are now clickable. However, there are other issue


## Instruction List 17

### Instructions
1. I've added screenshots of exported PDF page here in files starts with `after_instruction_list_16` in `screenshots/task-1` folder. You will see the UI looks odd.
2. It should look good. Every line of code shouldn't be centered. but it's container will be centered. The lists, should be in centered. The numbers and text of the list should not break
3. The exported pdf design should match with the preview in full screen view
4. Ensure the slide show and exported pdf supports all languages, not only english
5. In mobile view, the slide show height is fixed in a way that, the full content is not visible. It should always be visible
6. In full screen view, the background is black and the text is white. If the implementation auto detects browser theme and decides the color then it is ok. If not, it should auto detect browser theme and the foreground and background color should change according to light and dark theme. In full screen view, there could have a button to switch between light and dark theme.

### Comments
1. Aligning issue in PDF is not resolved
2. Theme styling seems half baked


## Instruction List 18

### Instructions
1. We are close. But the remaining issues are holding us back. They must need to be fixed. Think thoroughly. Research if necessary and plan carefully for no bug implementation. 
2. Theme switching works. However, the buttons doesn't look ok in full screen. They are not clear, doesn't show icons and doesn't switch color correctly according to icons
3. The aligning issue in pdf export is not fixed. Check the styling in full screen view on presentation mode. Then apply similar style on exported PDF. Ensure presentable PDF generation.

### Comments
1. Button in theme issue is solved. Other issue is not


## Instruction List 19

### Instructions
1. In mobile view, the editor height is surprisingly too low. There is blank space after that
2. In PDF, The alignment got slightly better. However, in lists, the bullet points and numbers are not on the same line of texts. But aligned left. Where the the text are centered
3. The coding still doesn't looks ok. They are left aligned. Note that, the code as a block must be centred of page. But each line of it, don't need to be centered, but aligned left of coding block
4. In presentation full screen, when dark mode is selected and pdf export is done, it should export the the file and it's content according to light theme. Dark theme is for presentation view only.
5. In presentation view, after pdf export, it should be kept in it's original selected theme design

### Comments
1. Some issues are still not fixed


## Instruction List 20

### Instructions
1. This is not fixed. It must be - In mobile view, the editor height is surprisingly too low. There is blank space after that
2. Let's not show the bullet points in pdf export. They are continuously left aligned. In slide presentation those are also not showed
3. Good work on handling code. However, on thing, the code as a block is not centered as page yet
