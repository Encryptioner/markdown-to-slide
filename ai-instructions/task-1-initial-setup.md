# Task 1: Initial Setup - Instructions

## General Rules
1. Write or update the summary of your updates in `ai-summaries/task-1-initial-setup.md` file when all the commanded tasks/instructions are done. Keep it short. Add summary of key files changed (with what functionality is changed there). You may update it in chronological way by step 1, step 2 and so on. It should reflect the continuos changes done on the codebase.

## Instruction List 2

### Instructions

2. Update Claude.md and README.md file to ensure they are updated. Remove mention of other package manager than `pnpm`. Add tech stack information in README
3. The text in markdown and slide viewer is not clear. Ensure, it works ok regardless of browser theme


### Comments
1. It fixed some issue. But there is more issue


## Instruction List 3

### Instructions
1. There is error related to `document.exitFullscreen?.();`
2. I think, the coloring has issues. The texts are not visible. The markdown background is dark. The slide background is white. The prev/next button doesn't show. When in full screen, the text shows in white background while the screen is black. Fix all coloring issue. The website doesn't need to support multiple theme. It should support light theme only. And it should work good.
3. The PDF popup doesn't look good on mobile screen. Ensure the website works good in all screen
4. The PDF export doesn't work correctly. It exports a blank page only
5. Check the project overview and ensure it fulfill all the required features, goals, standards

## Comments
1. I don't see any reasonable improvement


## Instruction List 4
1. I don't see any color related update. Check earlier instructions and ensure everything is done
2. There is error in console. Fix those

3. Ensure the code is production ready. It can be deployed as github pages and can be used as PWA


## Comments
1. The colors are updated and looks mostly ok now
2. The preview is good. However, the codes need to be shown with special care. It should look good in preview and full screen
3. The load example have issues. It doesn't load example. On load example, the slide number should be reset to 1
4. There should have undo/redo functionality in editor. And common keyboard shortcut for editors should work
5. On saved presentations, the name could be renamed
6. On mobile/small screen, hamburger menu seems not working
7. The `PDF` button still don't show the pdf with the content same as preview. It just shows blank pages. The pdf should be exported in a way that, it can later be used in other pdf/slide viewer to easily show as presentation


## Instruction List 5
1. Continue your earlier tasks
2. Check earlier comments and fix all issues
